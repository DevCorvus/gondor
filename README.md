Go RESTful API with Fiber and Gorm

In this simple API that in no way refers to the Lord of the Rings or the official mascot of the programming language... there is a simple authentication system based on cookies and json web tokens with users, gophers, some validation and little else among CRUD operations.

> I am aware that the average Go developer is not amused to see so many dirty dependencies dishonoring the capabilities of the language's glorious standard library. Forgive the offense, I just wanted to learn and experiment with some packages that would make the development experience more familiar to me and make it fun.

_Btw, this moment is so f\*cking epic..._ 😳🤯❤️
